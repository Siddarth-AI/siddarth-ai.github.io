### Projects
Ball Corporation People Analytics Case Competition – 3rd Place Mar 2024 – Apr 2024
Iowa Graduate Business Analytics Competition
• Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard for HR and Operations leaders to monitor workforce and operational KPIs (staffing,
turnover, absenteeism, tenure, efficiency, spoilage, safety, quality) across 16 plant locations; incorporated threshold-based early
warning signals and optimal vs actual variance tracking to support HR and operations leaders.
• Integrated time-series analytics and predictive regression models to quantify the impact of workforce characteristics (tenure,
absenteeism, turnover) on key plant-level metrics: efficiency, spoilage, safety (TRIR), and quality (HFI).
• Applied NLP and sentiment analysis on employee survey data to surface engagement, safety, and leadership factors affecting organizational health.
• Used SLSQP optimization via Python's SciPy to propose an optimal workforce profile for maximizing operational KPIs.
• Outperformed dozens of teams to secure 3rd place based on modeling depth, strategy, and stakeholder-focused storytelling.
