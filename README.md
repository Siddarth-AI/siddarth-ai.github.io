## Projects
### Ball Corporation People Analytics Case Competition – 3rd Place (_Mar 2024 – Apr 2024_)
- Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard for HR and Operations leaders to monitor workforce and operational KPIs (staffing, turnover, absenteeism, tenure, efficiency, spoilage, safety, quality) across 16 plant locations.
- Incorporated threshold-based early warning signals and optimal vs actual variance tracking to support HR and operations leaders.
- Integrated time-series analytics and predictive regression models to quantify the impact of workforce characteristics (tenure,
  absenteeism, turnover) on key plant-level metrics: efficiency, spoilage, safety (TRIR), and quality (HFI).
- Applied NLP and sentiment analysis on employee survey data to surface engagement, safety, and leadership factors affecting organizational health.
- Used SLSQP optimization via Python's SciPy to propose an optimal workforce profile for maximizing operational KPIs.
- Outperformed dozens of teams to secure 3rd place based on modeling depth, strategy, and stakeholder-focused storytelling.

### Crop Yield Forecasting & Risk Management Platform (_Jan 2024 - May 2024_)
- Designed and deployed a production-grade crop yield prediction system, integrating satellite radar backscatter (VV/VH) with NDVI, LSWI, and EVI vegetation indices, improving rice yield prediction accuracy from 67% to 94.3% through hyperparameter tuning and nested k‑fold cross‑validation.
- Engineered advanced geospatial and temporal features (e.g., time-slice segmentation, adaptive cloud-cover filtering) to model phenological growth patterns of rice across Vietnam, enabling stage-specific yield estimation.
- Implemented ensemble ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression with L2 regularization) on large-scale remote sensing datasets, generating actionable insights for agricultural risk mitigation and optimized resource allocation.
- Delivered insights via interactive visualizations and business impact briefs, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for crop insurance, supply chain planning, and disaster preparedness.

### Recidivism Risk prediction – Iowa DOC & ISU Public Safety Project (_Jan 2025 - May 2025_)
- Deployed a CatBoost-based ML model to predict 3-year recidivism risk for 30K+ individuals; achieved 0.89 AUC and 78% recall, improving targeting precision for post-release programs.
- Built a Streamlit-like Jupyter app for DOC officials to input offender profiles and receive explainable risk scores with real-time SHAP visualizations.
- Used SHAP explainability to identify and rank the top 10 predictive features (e.g., time since release, risk score deltas, prior offenses), improving transparency and decision confidence.
- Performed feature engineering using demographic, historical offense, and program completion data, and used clustering (k-modes + PCA) to recommend tailored rehabilitation cohorts expected to improve post-release success by 12-15%
- Proposed a data-driven pilot program for parole assessment, estimated to reduce re-offense rates by 8–10% annually, pending A/B test validation.

### Improving Preventive Care Engagement among Medicare Advantage LPPO Members (_Sep 2024 - Nov 2024_)
- Developed ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) to predict which LPPO members were at risk of skipping annual primary care visits; achieved AUC of 0.7634 and adjusted AUC of 0.7492.
- Engineered 12 high-signal features from claims, pharmacy logs, and utilization frequency, boosting model precision and recall by over 15%.
- Proposed and simulated an A/B testing framework for personalized outreach and pharmacy-integrated engagement strategies, enabling model-backed product experimentation.
